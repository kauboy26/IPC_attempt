# IMPORTANT NOTE:
I had not done inter process communication programming prior to this, and as a result
I consulted the official Python documentation on this topic [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket-objects).  

I followed through the examples to understand what was happening, and tried a couple of things.
I also consulted this [guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks-set-1/g/), and the
other articles in that series.  

I have left some comments here and there to explain what the parts do.
